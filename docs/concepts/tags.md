# Tags & Tag Definitions

Tagging data on Traces plays an important role in allow you to make sense of
your data. Our [Serverless Runtime](https://github.com/serverless/runtime)
instrumentation automatically collects the following tags defined by extending
the [Open Telemetry semantic tagging conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/http.md#common-attributes).
These tags are defined for each trace, but our UI provides an easy way to
navigate them without following the semantic names. If you already using Open
Telemetry be sure to see what tags we enforce [scopes](scopes.md) on. 

## Tag Definitions

**Cloud** - Cloud tags identify details specific to your cloud provider. 
- `cloud.region` - This is the region the code is deployed to `us-east-1`.
- `cloud.platform` - This is the type of compute target we are executing in.
Should be set to `lambda`.

**Deployment** - Deployment tags identify details about your specific
deployment.
- `deployment.environment` This is the environment an app is deployed to. It can
be defined as `stage` in `serverlss.yaml` file `prod`.

**FAAS Tags** - FAAS tags identify details function as a service platforms like
AWS Lambda.
- `faas.error_timeout` - Set when a timeout of an invocation occurs `TRUE`
- `faas.coldstart` - Set when a cold start of a Lambda function occurs `TRUE` 
- `faas.error` - This boolean is set to true if an invocation resulted in an
error `TRUE`
- `faas.event_type` - "This is the event type that this function was invoked
with `aws.sqs`
- `faas.name` - This the name of the single function that was invoked. 
`console-node-http-api-hello`
- `faas.error_exception_message` The error message if one is captured.
`Exception occured`

**HTTP Tags** - HTTP tags identify details for HTTP based API's
- `http.path` - This is the http path with the path that includes path param
place holders `/test/{id}`
- `http.method` - This is the http method of the request `GET`
- `http.status_code` - This will be the http status code set on the response
`200`

**Service Tags** - Service tags identify naming details about the underlying
resources of your service. 
- `service.name` This a resource name for the service that your function or
container is running in. For Serverless Framwork users this will combine your
stage, service name, and function name. `console-node-http-api`
- `service.namespace` The serverless organization app service name assigned to
this code. This can be specified as the service name in the `serverless.yaml`
file or will be inherited based in your compute envirionment.
`console-node-http-api`
