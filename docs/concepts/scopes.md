# Scopes
To make sense of Traces coming into our system we need to recognize them as
something we recognize. We call these patterns Scopes. Scopes are defined by a
set of tags we recognize being included on the [Trace](traces.md). When we
receive Traces that match one of our recognized Scopes we ingest it into our
system.


These scopes are represented in our UI as [Curated Metric Views](../using/metrics.md)
and include the following. 

**API** - This scope is used for displaying a Trace we recognize an HTTP based
API request. This scope requires the following tags.
- `http.path`
- `http.method`
- `http.status_code`

**All Functions** - This is used for displaying any Lambda function invocation.
The following tags are required on the trace to qualify as a function. 
- `faas.error_timeout`
- `faas.coldstart`
- `faas.error`
- `faas.event_type`
- `faas.name`

More details about tags are maintained in our [tag definition list](tags.md).
