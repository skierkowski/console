# Getting Started
Welcome to Serverless Console. 

The next-generation monitoring tool for Teams 
building with Serverless architectures. The easiest way 
to get started with Serverless Console is using the 
latest version of Serverless Framework (v3.18+ required).
**Note:** Only Node.js is supported at this time. 

```text
npm install -g serverless
```

You can configure an existing project with 
Serverless by adding `--console` flag to the serverless command. 

```text
serverless --console
```

This will set the following in your Serverless project. 

```yaml
console: true
org: my-org
service: my-aws-node-project

frameworkVersion: '3'
```

**Note:** If you are using Serverless Dashboard features be sure to keep an
app property set. This will give you access to existing dashboard
features like Providers, Parameters and Secrets. 

**Invoke your function, and login to Serverless Console**
Once you have deployed your function, do the following to start using Serverless Console.

1. Login to [Serverless Console](https://console.serverless.com) 
1. Invoke your function, or hit your API Endpoint

It may take a second for the first data point to show up,
but will speed up considerably from there. Each time you invoke
one of your instrumented functions, we receive [Traces](./concepts/traces.md) in Console. 

For more details see our [concepts section](./concepts) or learn about using [Serverless Console](./using/).
